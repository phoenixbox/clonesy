#Clonesy

This project was created as part of a collaborative 4 person gSchool project. We inherited a legacy code base, refactored, increased the test converage and quality before creating the Aphagram e-commerce store.

Aphagram is an Etsy clone which leveraged subdomains to allow users of the site to create their own stores, upload their products and sell them through Aphagram. As part of this 4 person team, we were quite proud of our TDD process and maintained excellent test quality and coverage throughout the build. I am most proud of my implementation of the admin statistics dashboard which used Morris.js and the Raphael JS graphing library to visualize admin sales statistics.

###What to look for
* Test Quality
* Composed Methods
